# VAE + MDN-RNN Visualization

[Draw Together with a Neural Network](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/sketch-rnn-demo)

this website allows you to play with MDN-RNNs, and it'll predict what you are drawing

it shows an insight on several different outputs, for the MDN in action

- it predicts different variations of the future
