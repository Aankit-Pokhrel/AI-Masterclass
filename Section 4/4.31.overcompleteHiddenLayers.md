# Overcomplete Hidden Layers

This and the next few tutorials are a highlevel overview of different types of AEs

Overcomplete Hidden Layers is an underlying concept in most of the variations of AEs

Here is a basic diagram of an AE:
![AE](./4.31.1.png)

there are:

- 4 input nodes
- 2 hidden nodes
- 4 output nodes

The Questions we are asking are:

- What if we wanted to increase the # of nodes in the hidden layer?
- What if we want to have more nodes in the hidden layer than the input layer?

Something like this

Why Would we do this?

- The Answer to this is
  - why not?

An AE can be used as a feature extraction tool, but what if we want more features?

there is a problem though:

- If we were to do this, the AE can cheat.
  - Meaning that as soon as you give it an amount of nodes the same size or larger than the amount of input nodes, then it can just assign a hidden layer node to one of the input nodes, and one of the output nodes.
    - in this case you may have extra nodes that aren't being used
  - This is entirely possible

there are many different approaches to solve the problem, we will cover 3 of the solutions in the following tutorials
