# Denoising AEs (DAE)

![AE](./4.31.2.jpg)

this is another RT, to solve the same issue from section 4.31 regarding AEs

what we do in this form is we replace the input values with a modified version of the inputs

![DAE](4.33.1.jpg)

we take the inputs, and randomly turn some of them into 0s

![DAE.1](4.33.2.jpg)

then once we put it through the AE, we compare the output with the original values, and that prevents the AE from directly outputting the inputs

![DAE.1](4.33.3.jpg)

this type of AE is a stochastic AE, it depends on the random selection of which values are 0'd out
