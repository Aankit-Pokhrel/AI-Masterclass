# How do Neural Networks Work?

we will look at a NN that predicts property values

We will focus on the application of the NN, training will be next section

## Application

### Section 1

Let's say we have 4 inputs

1. Area (feet^2) - X1
2. Bedrooms - X2
3. Distance to city (Miles) - X3
4. Age - X4

![How NNs Work](./NN%20Training%20How%20NNs%20Work.png)

These 4 inputs will comprise our input layer

in a very basic form a NN only has an input and output layer

the output layer (in this instance) will output the price of the house

the price will be calculated using the following function

- $$\text{Price} = \sum_{n=1}^{4} W_n \cdot X_n$$

Neural networks give the user an advantage that gives more power and flexability

### Section 2

Legend:

- Dotted lines mean the weight is 0
- Solid lines mean the weight is non 0

The reason for zero value weights is because not all inputs are important for all Neurons

in this case X1 and X3 are important, but X2 and X4 are not

But why would we do this?

- Maybe the neuron recognizes that the further you get away from the city the larger the area that is available
  - And probably what this neuron is doing is looking for hosues not too far from the city, but have a larger area
  - the neuron will activate when certain criteria is met

The weights are calculated during training

A better way to display this would be to only connect X1 and X3 to Z1 instead of using the dotted lines, this is to limit confusion

### Section 3

![How NNs work 3](./NN%20Training%20How%20NNs%20Work3.png)

we will look at Z3 this time

The only inputs with non-zero weights are X1, X2, and X3

What is the thinking of the neuron?

- the neuron has realized the area + bedroom + age is important
- Maybe in the specific city, there are alot of families that are looking for new and large properties with more bedrooms

This neuron values size, bedroom # and Age

### Section 4

![NN Training How NNs Work4](./NN%20Training%20How%20NNs%20Work4.png)

We will look at Z5 this time

The only non-zero input is X4

why is this the case?

- larger the age lesser the value
- but if a property is over a certain age it may become a historic property and that can be valued more by some people
- this is a simple example of the rectifier function being applied

the Neurons can pickup any number of parameters, and the combinations may be ones that the user never would have taken into account

if trained properly, the NN can accurately provide an output, in this case a price
