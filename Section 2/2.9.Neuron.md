# The Neuron

the neuron is the basic building block of Artifical Networks (AN)

AN neurons are based on the bilological neuron

structured with an input layer with n amount of inputs, x amount of hidden layers with y amount of neurons, and an output layer

## The way it's done

- A neuron works by sending synapses to other neurons
- A neuron in ANs has input signals (values), and an output signal
  - input signals can also be other neurons
- the input pipeline is called synapses
- inputs are independed variables
  - these inputs are used for training, or actual use of the AI
  - the variables need to be standardized or normalized
    - Standardizing is the process of making sure the variables have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1
    - normalizing is the process of making the values between 0 and 1
      - can be done by subtracting the min value and dividing by ( maxVal - minVal )
    - whether you normalize or standardize is based on the scenario and will be covered later
    - this is done to make it easier for the NN to process the variables easily
- put in values of 1 row, get output for 1 row
- the synapses are all assigned weights
  - this is how the NN learns
  - by adjusting the weights, the NN decides in each case which signal is important for a specific neuron.

### What happens inside the neuron?

1. takes the weighted sum of the values
   - $$\sum_{i=0}^{m} W_i \cdot X_i$$
2. Applies an Activation function
   - a function assigned to the neuron or layer the output is the signal that is passed on
   - based on the output the neuron may or may not pass a signal
3. signal is passed on
