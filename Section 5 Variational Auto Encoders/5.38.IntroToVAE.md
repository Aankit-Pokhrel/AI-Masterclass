# Introduction to Variational Auto Encoders (VAE)

In this section we will cover VAEs, and the purpose of VAEs in this model

## Purpose

<a href="https://worldmodels.github.io/" target=_blank> Here is a Link describing models </a>

![AE-Model](./5.38.1.jpg)

Here we see this model, the top is the encoding portion of an AE, where we do the convolutions. The bottom is the decoding, where we do the deconvolutions.

in the middle we see a bottleneck, this is the VAE

![VAE](./5.38.2.jpg)

what purpose does this serve?

the whole purpose of the entire AE model, is to allow our AI model to "dream" and come up with solutions in the dream

what the VAE does is it creates the dream

this "Dream" allows it to "see" the features, and extract the features that actually matter.

The VAE comes in in the "Dream" (in reality, just the compressed version of the original image).

In the middle of a VAE there exists a stochastic component. This allows us to create varying representations every time, which allows the AE to have more diverse training, even with the same inputs, in which it can learn from.

This approach allows the AI learn better, and more efficiently.
