# Summary

So Far we have:

![Summary](./3.24.1.jpg)

1. started with an input image
2. applied feature detectors to convolve it, and get the feature maps
   - this makes up our convolutional layer
3. we applied the RELu to increase nonlinearity in our image
4. We pooled the feature maps to make sure that we have spacial invariance, and made pooling layer
5. We flattened the Pooling Layers into a column of values
6. input the flattened data into an ANN
7. Process the features, and train
