# Implementing CNN and VAE

Congratulations, you have reached the first implementation phase. In this section, we will build a CNN-VAE, i.e. a Variational AutoEncoder with a CNN encoding the input states (frames). The most important to understand here is that in this section, we will give the AI the ability to dream.

Here is the plan of Attack to tackle this implementation:

1. Initializing all the parameters and variables of the CNN-VAE class
2. Building the Encoder part of the VAE
3. Building the "V" part of the VAE
4. Building the Decoder part of the VAE
5. Implementing the training operations
