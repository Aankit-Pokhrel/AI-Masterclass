# Hello

Congratulations, you have reached the first implementation phase. In this section, we will build a CNN-VAE, i.e. a Variational AutoEncoder with a CNN encoding the input states (frames). The most important to understand here is that in this section, we will give the AI the ability to dream.

Here is the plan of Attack to tackle this implementation:

1. Initializing all the parameters and variables of the CNN-VAE class
2. Building the Encoder part of the VAE
3. Building the "V" part of the VAE
4. Building the Decoder part of the VAE
5. Implementing the training operations

Also, please find below the TensorFlow documentation for the important functions and classes we will use in this section:

tf.placeholder

tf.layers.conv2d

tf.reshape

tf.layers.dense

tf.layers.conv2d_transpose

tf.Variable

tf.reduce_sum

tf.reduce_mean

tf.train.AdamOptimizer

tf.global_variables_initializer
